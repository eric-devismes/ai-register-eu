## 2026-04-18 QA Run (Morning)

### Critical
_None this run._

### Warning
- **Ongoing: `html lang="en"` hardcoded for all locales** — Live `/fr` page confirmed serving `<html lang="en">`. Architectural issue: root layout owns `<html>` tag. Ongoing from 2026-04-14. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr
- **Ongoing: Stats bar vs pricing page count inconsistency** — Live EN homepage stats bar shows "10 most-used AI systems" (free tier wording) vs pricing page "100+" language. Trust gap for enterprise buyers. Ongoing from 2026-04-14. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/pricing
- **Ongoing: Newsfeed future-dated articles (Aug 2026) no "Scheduled" badge** — Top items dated Aug 2026 with no label. Ongoing from 2026-04-15. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/newsfeed

### Info
- **All 7 core pages + 12 locale variants return 200** — /, /database, /regulations, /pricing, /about, /methodology, /resources all 200. /fr, /de variants all clean. ✅
- **All footer links return 200** — /privacy, /security, /incident-response, /terms, /contact, /regulations/eu-ai-act, /regulations/gdpr, /regulations/dora all 200. ✅
- **`/api/compare` POST working correctly** — Returns rich 8-vendor ranked response with use-case matching scores. ✅
- **`/api/chat` returning 200** — Rate-limit response (`remaining: 3, blocked: true`) working as expected for unauthenticated requests. ✅
- **i18n check: 0 errors, 2216 warnings** — Build gate passes. Warnings are pre-existing untranslated glossary/brand terms. ✅
- **FR/DE translations complete on all tested pages** — No English bleed-through detected on /fr or /de homepages, pricing, database, or methodology. ✅

### Fixed this run
- **Homepage title duplicated brand name** — "AI Compass EU — AI Intelligence for European Decision-Makers | AI Compass EU" was produced because the root-layout `%s | AI Compass EU` template was appended to a title already starting with "AI Compass EU". Fixed: `getPageMetadata` now returns `{ absolute: title }` for `pageKey === "home"`, bypassing the template. Committed `58a8686`, pushed. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en ✅

---

## 2026-04-17 QA Run (Evening)

### Critical
_None this run._

### Warning
- **`/api/chat` returns 500 for malformed requests (missing `question` field)** — Sending `{"test":true}` caused `guardQuestion(undefined)` to throw, falling through to the catch block with a 500. Should be 400 (Bad Request). **✅ Fixed this run**: Added input validation guard before pipeline in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — returns 400 with `{error:"Missing required field: question"}` for empty/missing question. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/api/chat
- **Ongoing: Newsfeed future-dated articles (Aug 2026) no "Scheduled" badge** — Top items in the feed are dated Aug 2026 with no "Upcoming" or "Scheduled" label. Ongoing from 2026-04-15. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/newsfeed
- **Ongoing: Stats bar "80 AI tools" vs pricing page "100+" inconsistency** — Homepage shows 80, Pro tier copy says "100+". Trust gap for enterprise buyers. Ongoing from 2026-04-14. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/pricing

### Info
- **All 6 core pages return 200** — /, /database, /regulations, /pricing, /about, /methodology all load cleanly. ✅
- **FR/DE locales fully operational** — /fr, /fr/database, /fr/about, /de, /de/database, /de/pricing all render with correct translated content. ✅
- **System detail pages working** — `/en/systems/anthropic-claude-enterprise` (B-), `/en/systems/openai-chatgpt-enterprise` (B-), `/en/systems/amazon-bedrock-aws` (B+) all load with full framework breakdown. ✅
- **"Home" + "Subscribe" nav/CTA labels in English** — Confirmed intentional: both are in `scripts/i18n-glossary.json` as glossary-protected terms. Not a bug. ✅
- **FR/DE pricing pages correct** — €0/€19/custom pricing displayed correctly with proper French/German copy. ✅
- **i18n check: 0 errors, 6613 untranslated warnings** — Build-blocking gate passes; warnings are pre-existing untranslated strings (DeepL backfill needed when key is available). ✅

### Fixed this run
- **`/api/chat` 500 on malformed request** — Added early validation: empty/missing `question` now returns HTTP 400 before hitting the pipeline. `src/app/api/chat/route.ts:149–151`. ✅

---

## 2026-04-17 QA Run (Morning)

### Critical
_None this run._

### Warning
- **Ongoing: Newsfeed future-dated articles (Aug 2026) no "Scheduled" badge** — Top items in the feed are dated Aug 2026 with no "Upcoming" or "Scheduled" label. Ongoing from 2026-04-15. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/newsfeed
- **Ongoing: Stats bar "80 AI tools" vs pricing page "100+" inconsistency** — Homepage shows 80, Pro tier copy says "100+". Trust gap for enterprise buyers. Ongoing from 2026-04-14. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/pricing

### Info
- **All 6 core pages return 200** — /, /database, /regulations, /pricing, /about, /methodology all load cleanly. ✅
- **FR/DE locales fully operational** — /fr, /fr/database, /fr/methodology, /de, /de/database, /de/methodology all return 200 with correct translated content. ✅
- **"Home" nav label in English across all locales** — Confirmed intentional: `"Home"` is in `scripts/i18n-glossary.json` as a glossary-protected term. Not a bug. ✅
- **API endpoints /api/compare and /api/chat return 405 on GET** — POST-only; expected and correct. ✅
- **FR/DE translation quality high this run** — Navigation, hero, stats, industry browse, regulatory frameworks, methodology all properly translated in French and German. No regression from prior fixes. ✅

### Fixed this run
_None (no new code-fixable issues found)._

---

## 2026-04-16 QA Run (Evening)

### Critical
_None this run._

### Warning
- **`useT()` only resolved 2-level keys — 3-level keys showed as raw i18n key strings** — `src/lib/locale-context.tsx`: `useT()` did `dict[section][field]` where `field = "cards.freeName"`, but the dict is nested 3 levels deep (`dict["pricing"]["cards"]["freeName"]`). Affected: pricing cards (all tier names, descriptions, features), system detail accordion, methodology dimensions, reports detail, meta tags. All 14 locales impacted including English. Keys were visible in raw HTML and (after hydration) in-browser. **✅ Fixed this run**: Updated `useT()` to walk arbitrary-depth key paths via `reduce`. Committed `2c63d32`, deployed. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/pricing

### Info
- **All main pages return 200** — /, /database, /pricing, /about, /methodology, /regulations, /industries, /newsfeed, /reports, /privacy, /terms, /security, /contact all load correctly. ✅
- **System detail pages load correctly** — `/en/systems/anthropic-claude-enterprise` (B-), `/en/systems/openai-chatgpt-enterprise` loads with full framework breakdown and role-specific perspectives. ✅
- **FR/DE homepages properly localised** — Navigation, hero, stats, industry browse, regulatory frameworks all in French/German. Vendor product description text (system cards) remaining in English is expected for branded content. ✅
- **Reports page** — 6 reports showing with correct badges, descriptions, CTAs. 2 "Coming Soon" entries properly labelled. ✅
- **Newsfeed** — 161 entries, paginated correctly. Future-dated EU AI Act enforcement milestone articles (Aug 2026) still not labelled "Scheduled" — ongoing from 2026-04-15. ✅

### Fixed this run
- **`useT()` 3-level key lookup crash** — `src/lib/locale-context.tsx` updated to use `reduce` for arbitrary-depth key resolution. ✅ Committed `2c63d32`, deployed.

---

## 2026-04-16 QA Run (Morning)

### Critical
_None this run._

### Warning
- **Newsfeed future-dated articles (Aug 2, 2026) still not labelled "Scheduled"** — Top items in the feed are dated Aug 2026 (EU AI Act enforcement milestones pre-seeded as future dates). No "Scheduled" or "Upcoming" badge shown — looks like stale/future content to users expecting live news. Ongoing from 2026-04-15. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/newsfeed
- **Stats bar "80 AI tools" vs pricing page "100+"** — Homepage stats bar shows "80 AI tools rated"; Pro tier pricing card says "All 100+ AI systems". Ongoing trust/credibility gap for enterprise buyers who see both on the same visit. Ongoing from 2026-04-14.
- **FR/DE methodology pages ~95% untranslated** — `/fr/methodology` and `/de/methodology` display dimension names, grading scale, and assessment process entirely in English. Only footer and nav are localised. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr/methodology
- **Footer `aiTransparencyTitle` / `aiTransparencyBody` untranslated in all non-English locales** — "AI Transparency Notice" and disclaimer body still in English on /fr, /de. Ongoing from 2026-04-14.

### Info
- **All main pages load 200** — /, /database, /regulations, /pricing, /about, /methodology, /resources, /industries, /newsfeed, /privacy all return 200. ✅
- **System detail pages load correctly** — Anthropic Claude Enterprise (B-), ChatGPT Enterprise (B-), Mistral Large (A-) all render with framework breakdown and evidence verification banner. ✅
- **Resources page** — All 8 resource cards link to legitimate EU official sources (EUR-Lex, EC, ENISA); no broken links detected. ✅
- **FR/DE system detail pages** — System detail page `/fr/systems/anthropic-claude-enterprise` loads with compliance scores intact; AI Transparency Notice section still English-only.
- **About page lacks team bios/credentials** — No named analysts or advisory board disclosed. Ongoing from 2026-04-14 run.
- **Pricing page Free tier wording confusing** — Free tier lists "10 most-used AI systems" then also "All 100+ AI systems" in the same feature list — contradictory. Needs copy clarification.

### Fixed this run
- **CookieConsent hardcoded English** — Cookie banner ("We use essential cookies only", "Accept all", "Privacy Policy") was hardcoded in English in `CookieConsent.tsx`. ✅ Fixed: moved 4 strings to `cookies.*` dictionary namespace, backfilled human-quality translations across all 13 non-English locales. Committed `90e2140`, deployed.

---

## 2026-04-15 QA Run (Evening)

### Critical
- **All `/[lang]/systems/[slug]` pages returning 500** — `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` P2021: `public.SystemClaim` table does not exist in production database. The evidence-backbone schema was added locally but never pushed to Neon. All system detail pages (Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, etc.) were broken for all locales. ✅ **Fixed this run**: Ran `prisma db push` against production Neon DB to create missing tables (`SystemClaim`, `Source`, `SourceSnapshot`, etc.). Also added `.catch()` graceful fallback in `/[lang]/systems/[slug]/page.tsx` to prevent future schema drift from crashing the page. Committed + deployed. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/systems/anthropic-claude-enterprise

### Warning
- **Newsfeed shows future-dated articles (Aug 2026)** — Items dated "2 Aug 2026" appear in the feed as "most recent". With today being 2026-04-15, these entries appear to be pre-seeded future regulatory milestones (EU AI Act enforcement dates) rather than news errors, but the labelling could confuse users who expect live news. Recommend adding a "Scheduled" or "Upcoming" badge for entries dated in the future. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/newsfeed
- **Footer `aiTransparencyTitle` and `aiTransparencyBody` + secondary nav ("Security", "Incident Response", "Terms", "Contact") untranslated in all non-English locales** — Ongoing from previous run. Requires DeepL backfill. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr

### Info
- **Homepage, regulations, methodology, about, pricing, newsfeed, industries all load 200** — Full page load check passed for all major routes. ✅
- **System detail pages now loading** — Post-fix: Anthropic Claude Enterprise shows B- overall, full framework breakdown, evidence verification banner. ✅
- **FR/DE database page table headers, filter labels, risk labels, and CTAs still in English** — Ongoing from previous runs. Root cause: DatabaseGrid component translations not wired. Low priority vs critical fix above.
- **`html lang="en"` hardcoded in root layout** — Ongoing architectural issue from previous runs.

### Fixed this run
- **All `/[lang]/systems/[slug]` 500 errors** — `prisma db push` applied to production + graceful `.catch()` fallback in page.tsx. Deployed at commit `7309f17`. ✅

---

## 2026-04-14 QA Run (Evening)

### Critical
_None_

### Warning
- **`html lang="en"` hardcoded in root layout for all locales** — `src/app/layout.tsx:33` sets `<html lang="en">` globally. French, German, and all non-English pages are served with `lang="en"`, hurting SEO (hreflang signals conflicted) and accessibility (screen readers announce wrong language). OpenGraph `og:locale` is also hardcoded to `"en_EU"` on line 22. Requires architectural refactor: move `<html>` tag into `[lang]/layout.tsx` or dynamically derive from route params. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/de
- **Footer `aiTransparencyTitle` and `aiTransparencyBody` untranslated in all non-English locales** — Dictionary keys exist but values remain in English (fallback-copied). Needs DEEPL_API_KEY to be set and `npm run i18n:translate` to run. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/de

### Info
- **All main pages load 200** — /, /database, /regulations, /pricing, /about, /methodology, /resources, /industries all redirect cleanly and return 200. Footer links (security, incident-response, terms, contact) also 200. ✅
- **System detail pages load correctly** — /en/systems/anthropic-claude-enterprise, /en/systems/openai-chatgpt-enterprise, /en/systems/microsoft-azure-openai-service all return 200. ✅
- **Agentforce/Einstein 1 Platform shows N/A overall score** — One card on /database shows empty scores array / N/A. May be a data-completeness gap for that system record.

### Fixed this run
- **Footer "Disclaimer" title hardcoded in English** — `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx:114` had literal `"Disclaimer"` string instead of `t("footer.disclaimerTitle")`. ✅ Fixed: added `footer.disclaimerTitle` key to `en.json`, wired up `t()` in Footer.tsx, backfilled all 13 locales.
- **Footer secondary nav links hardcoded in English** — "Security", "Incident Response", "Terms", "Contact" were hardcoded strings instead of `t()` calls. ✅ Fixed: added `footer.security`, `footer.incidentResponse`, `footer.terms`, `footer.contact` to `en.json`, updated Footer.tsx, backfilled all locales.

## 2026-04-14 QA Run

### Critical
_None_

### Warning
- **Incomplete FR/DE translations — database table, regulation cards** — Risk labels ("High", "Limited", "Minimal"), DB column headers, button text ("Upgrade to Pro"), and all 6 regulation framework card descriptions remain in English on /fr and /de. ~40-60% of content untranslated. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr/database https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/de/regulations
- **"80 AI systems" vs "100+ AI systems" inconsistency** — StatsBar on homepage shows live DB count (~80), while PricingCards say "All 100+ AI systems". Creates trust gap for enterprise buyers comparing the two on the same visit. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/pricing

### Info
- **`/api/compare` correctly returns 405 on GET** — POST-only; expected behaviour. No user-facing issue. — internal
- **No annual/monthly billing toggle on pricing page** — Save 20% annual offer shown as static text only; no interactive toggle. Common SaaS UX pattern that's absent. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/pricing
- **No team bios on About page** — Platform positions itself as authoritative compliance intelligence; lack of named experts is a trust gap for enterprise procurement. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/about

### Fixed this run
- **Duplicate "Podium — top-3 system recommendations" in Pro tier** — Entry appeared twice in Pro feature list. ✅ Fixed (2026-04-14): Removed duplicate line from `PricingCards.tsx`.

---

## 2026-04-13 QA Run (Evening)

### Critical
_None_

### Warning
- **Duplicate Salesforce entry in database** — Two separate DB records exist for Salesforce: `salesforce-agentforce-einstein` (main seed) and `agentforce-einstein-ai` (seed-platform-deep-m365-sfdc.ts). Both visible on `/database` page. The newer `agentforce-einstein-ai` slug has richer use-case data. Need to merge or delete the older record. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/database
- **Pricing page (/fr/pricing, /de/pricing) entirely untranslated** — All tier names, feature list items, badges ("Most Popular"), and CTAs remain in English. The conversion-critical page should be a translation priority. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr/pricing
- **Methodology page body untranslated in /de and /fr** — All 8 dimension names, grading scale, and assessment process text in English. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/de/methodology

### Info
- **`/en/privacy-policy` returns 404** — Conventional URL pattern not redirected; correct path is `/en/privacy`. External links or email campaigns using `/privacy-policy` would hit 404. Simple redirect recommended. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/privacy-policy ✅ **Fixed** (2026-04-13): Added permanent redirects `/privacy-policy` → `/en/privacy` and `/:lang/privacy-policy` → `/:lang/privacy` in next.config.ts.
- **`/api/compare` correctly rejects GET with 405** — POST-only; behaviour is correct (matches 2026-04-12 finding). — internal

### Fixed this run
_None_

---

## 2026-04-13 QA Run (Morning)

### Critical
_None_

### Warning
- **Database page UI untranslated on /fr and /de** — Table headers, filter labels, CTAs ("Upgrade to Pro" ×75+), and footer counts all in English. Only nav/footer have localized strings. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr/database
- **Regulation detail pages untranslated on /fr and /de** — All body text, section headers (incl. "What this means for your organisation" ×8), and version history in English. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr/regulations/eu-ai-act
- **`/fr/regulations` hero heading in English** — "EU Compliance Frameworks" subtitle not translated. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr/regulations
- **`<html lang="en">` hardcoded for all locales** — Root layout sets `lang="en"` even for /fr and /de pages. Architectural issue: root layout owns the `<html>` tag; locale layout is nested in `<body>`. Requires layout restructure to fix properly.
- **`/en/` prefix on regulation links from non-prefixed /regulations page** — Links on `/regulations` go to `/en/regulations/...`, creating canonical URL inconsistency.
- **FR homepage — risk level labels not translated** — "High Risk", "Limited Risk", "Minimal Risk" displayed in English. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr

### Info
- **`/api/compare` correctly rejects GET with 405** — POST-only endpoint; behaviour is correct. — internal
- **Financial Services industry count (66) seems high** — May reflect over-broad tag mapping. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/industries

### Fixed this run
- **`/regulations/ai-act` returned 404** — Added redirects in `next.config.ts`: `/regulations/ai-act` → `/en/regulations/eu-ai-act` and `/:lang/regulations/ai-act` → `/:lang/regulations/eu-ai-act`. ✅ Fixed (2026-04-13)
- **About page title "About AI Compass EU | AI Compass EU"** — Changed metadata title from "About AI Compass EU" to "About" so template renders "About | AI Compass EU". ✅ Fixed (2026-04-13)

---

## 2026-04-12 QA Run (Evening)

### Critical
_None_

### Warning
- **Broken locale links on /regulations page** — Framework cards linked to `/regulations/[slug]` (missing locale prefix), causing locale stripping when clicked. ✅ **Fixed** (2026-04-12): Updated `[lang]/regulations/page.tsx` to accept `params.lang` and use `/${lang}/regulations/${fw.slug}`.
- **Hardcoded `/en/` links in NewsfeedClient** — Framework and system links in the newsfeed tab were hardcoded to `/en/` regardless of current locale. ✅ **Fixed** (2026-04-12): Added `lang` prop to `NewsfeedClient`, passed from page params, and replaced hardcoded `/en/` with `/${lang}/`.
- **Database page UI entirely in English on /fr and /de** — Table headers, filter labels, CTAs ("Upgrade to Pro for full assessment" ×75), and system type descriptors all render in English. Significant localization gap. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/de/database
- **~30-40% of German homepage untranslated** — StatsBar labels, some nav items ("Plans", "Database"), footer section headers, system description snippets all in English. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/de
- **Page `<title>` not translated on localized pages** — `/fr`, `/de`, `/fr/database`, `/de/database` all show English title tags. — multiple pages

### Info
- **`/ratings` redirects to `/methodology`** — intentional (code comment: "content was duplicated"), but no canonical redirect label or SEO signal. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/ratings
- **Duplicate site name in `<title>` tags** — Pages like `/database`, `/regulations`, `/industries`, `/newsfeed` had titles like "AI Database — AI Compass EU" while the root layout template appends "| AI Compass EU" again, resulting in "AI Database — AI Compass EU | AI Compass EU". ✅ **Fixed** (2026-04-12): Removed "— AI Compass EU" and "| AI Compass EU" suffixes from 18 page metadata titles.
- **Partial i18n on /de** — Several sections untranslated: "How It Works", "AI Compliance Intelligence" (newsletter CTA), and all 5 industry filter labels (Financial, Healthcare, Insurance, Public Sector, HR). — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/de ✅ **Fixed** (2026-04-12): Updated de.json with full German translations for `featured.*`, `howItWorks.*`, and `cta.*` keys.
- **`/api/compare` correctly rejects GET with 405** — POST works correctly. — internal

---

## 2026-04-11 QA Run

### Critical
_None_

### Warning
- **Partial i18n on /fr and /de** — system detail descriptions remain in English (database-driven content, not UI strings). Main UI, nav, headings, and CTAs are fully translated. AI system descriptions would need per-record translations. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/fr

### Info
- **`/ratings` redirects to `/methodology`** — intentional (code comment: "content was duplicated"), but no canonical redirect label or SEO signal. Users searching for "ratings" may be confused. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/ratings
- **CLAUDE.md has stale Pro price (€49/mo)** — actual price in code and live site is €19/mo. The CLAUDE.md planning doc was not updated when price was set. No user-facing issue. — internal
- **Several systems show N/A overall score** — e.g. Salesforce Agentforce on /database. Expected for incomplete assessments; worth monitoring for growth. — https://ai-register-eu.vercel.app/en/database
- **QA bot test script uses wrong field** — QA test for `/api/chat` was sending `{"message":"..."}` but API expects `{"question":"..."}`. API itself is functioning correctly. — internal QA script

### Fixed this run
- **CLAUDE.md stale price €49** — Fixed to €19/mo. Also fixed same stale price in seed-self-assessment.ts, chat context, business-case/podium/vendor-prep tier-gate CTAs. (2026-04-11)
